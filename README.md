# umd-job-offers

### What is this?
This is literally just a spreadsheet containing job offers received by UMD students. This is meant to help students in job search so that they don't blindly accept the first offer they get.

### How do I add my data?
Create a branch, add your job offer history to it, and create a PR. I'll likely accept it unless it is clearly false. 

> **This is meant to be a helpful resource. Don't screw up offers for other people!**
